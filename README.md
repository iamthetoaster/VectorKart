## How To Play VectorKart
This is a turn based game. You can only move your car during your turn. Each turn you are able to create a small acceleration vector (by clicking) in order to slightly modify your velocity. Try not to crash into the wall. Whoever makes it around the map first or with the least wall crashes wins!
